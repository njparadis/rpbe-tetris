## Rust Programming by Example: Tetris
This repo holds the code for my implmentation of the classic game Tetris in Rust. I followed along with [Rust Programming By Example](https://www.packtpub.com/product/rust-programming-by-example/9781788390637) for the most part, but I made a few changes to the design in places where it felt decisions were made to prioritize showing off language features over what made the most sense.

### Dependencies
This project uses SDL2 for graphics - to install the bindings, take a look at the relevant section in the [rust-sdl2 documentation](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#sdl20-development-libraries).
